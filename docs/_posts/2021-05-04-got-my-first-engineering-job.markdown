I got my first engineering job yesterday. After a couple dozen rejections or so, I can officially call myself a software engineer. Although I took the circuitous route, I'm not done. 

My official title will be Junior Data Engineer. And I won't feel safe until after the four-month probation period ending in mid-September.

But convincing a group of people that I'm capable enough for them to hire me is an achievement in itself.
